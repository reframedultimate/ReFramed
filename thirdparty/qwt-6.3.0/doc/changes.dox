engine still has serious performance issues with rendering long polylines.

\section CURVE QwtPlotCurve

	- QwtPlotCurve::adjacentPoint
	  for monotonic curves: using a binary search algo

	- QwtPlotCurve::interpolatedValueAt
	  for monotonic curves: using a binary search algo

\section SERIESDATA QwtSeriesData

    - wrong inheritances fixed
	- firstSample, lastSample added

\section INTERVALCURVE QwtPlotIntervalCurve

	QwtPlotIntervalCurve::TubeAsLines mode added. A performance optimization
    for rendering huge datasets.
