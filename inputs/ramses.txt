Timing
- option to select timings between specific moves
- Want to know how quickly he was able to react after getting e.g. sheik ftilted

Two main dimensions you can analyze in smash
- Space
- Time

Sparg0 vs Tweek
- How often does sparg0 whiff
- How far away does he whiff
- What moves does he whiff
- Where does he whiff

Want to see things like
- Every time pikachu does an aerial out of corner, but
  + only if he's in the corner
  + and if opponent is close
  + or if pikachu is in THIS area, and cloud is in THIS OTHER area
  + and is at THIS percent

To define positions (in UI):
- Want to have a list of situations
- See the stage, select an area, select a percentage range -> define this as a situation
- Limit the search to this situation

Want to query not only what I am doing, but what the opponent is doing at the same time

Have a list of states (State List) for both players

Be able to differentiate between rising and falling aerials

Data analysis: Data Cascades (in eye tracking)

Corner analysis very important

Inclusive zones, but also define exclusive zones

Ability to define your own zones, "zone editor"

Have universal zones, but also have player specific and character specific zones.

Big thing: Relate your searches to what the opponent is doing

Idea: Left pane is for player 1, Right pane is for player 2
