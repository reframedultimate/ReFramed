unknown stage

Sparg0:
- search of position for dashback

grid pattern
- if megaman is in such a spot, pikachu tends to get nair -> grab (for example)
- 

Tony grid
- grid is not uniform but has specific spacings depending on the stage and character
- vertical lines are spaced based on shorthop height and fullhop height, for example
- horizontal lines positioned at distances for ledge options
- distances from where are you going to go after a ledge roll (for example)
- there will be some universal spots
  + spot right beneath platform edges
  + center stage

high level players will focus on something different than toplevel
